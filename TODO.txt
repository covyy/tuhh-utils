FEED
- Use cron instead of interval for fetching new messages, and don't fetch during the night
- Use axios instead of https module
- Better code structure, not everything in 1 file
- Since a Discord Bot exists, maybe use that instead of webhooks
- Notifs for File/Lecture Uploads/Updates
- Notifs for WebWork/Ilias


TU-GPT (in bot.js)
- Train on PDFs from official TUHH websites
- Generate LaTeX and render it?
- Speed


SERVER
- Add DEV/PROD modes
- Add logging
- Rate limits and basic security
- When user does /ical, check of the TUNE site actually downloads the ical file, and if not, tell user it is outdated
- prevent ical downloads if the useragent gives away, that it's not the iOS calendar
- Since the user's calendar is available, track it for updates and notify the user if something changes (per DMs)


GENERAL
- Add a proper README
- Add a LICENSE
- Make an API (on the server) giving access to all these features without having to code your own crawler
- Replace deprecated dependencies
- move SSL keys to env variables or config
- Error handling, maybe use something like sentry, discord err log channel
